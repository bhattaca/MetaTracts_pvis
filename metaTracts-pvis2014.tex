%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Carbon fiber reinforced polymers are bundles of individual carbon fibers woven into sheets of carbon fiber cloth which are layered
and reinforced by an epoxy material. Industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography (XCT) generates a 3D volumetric representation of a scanned object, reconstructed from a series of 2D penetration images,
taken throughout a full rotation of the object.	We describe a technique for extracting and visualizing fiber bundles in fiber reinforced composites scanned with X-ray computed tomography.
Our goal is to visualize the geometric structures of the weaving pattern by analyzing large  areas of  composite woven fabrics using XCT scans of low resolution. Individual fibers are barely visible in such scans. We apply and extend methods originally developed for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on the generated XCT data. In the first step a coarse version of integral curves is used to extract sections of the fiber bundles in the woven fabrics. We call these sections MetaTracts.
In the next step the extracted fiber bundle sections are clustered using a two phase approach, wherein we first cluster according to orientation and then  cluster by proximity. We test our algorithm on a number of data sets and show that it effectively identifies and separates different fiber bundles. This work will provide a stepping stone to introduce novel non destructive testing techniques for reinforced fiber bundles analysis.
